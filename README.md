# Lantum frontend take home task

## ABOUT

This is a very simple react app based on [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) repo.
It fetches data from the endpoint and displays relevant data in the list.


## SETUP

1. `npm install` - to install dependencies
2. `npm start` - to start the app
3. `npm test` - to run tests


## TODO
Next steps would involve:
1. using component like [react-big-calendar](https://github.com/jquense/react-big-calendar) to display data in more readable way (similar to google calendar).
2. add user interactions and e2e/integration tests
3. add handling errors for fetching data from URL
4. add backend/node layer to handle API calls (maybe?)
